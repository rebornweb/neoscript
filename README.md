#The Bella Theme is a General SASS/HTML5 Theme to start with 

Working Demo of the simple Bella put in action for a E-commerce website at
http://bella.rebornweb.co.nz but i changed the header and the navigation on this site.

#What's here is just the 'simple version of the Bella Theme'

Which is Responsive and Has a "Hamburger" and Dropdown menu Nav Using SASS/css,
I recommend you switch to using a SASS compiler which generates CSS if you haven't
already :)

and Metronome working for the world to tinker with.

You just have to do A /dev/build and ?flush=all after adding in the theme and mysite code.

#There is Also a Waving Animation Waving.js

Wishing you guys would fork it play with it as you wish,
it is fun, also a nightmare :) it waves a whole line in a anchor wrapped with
any element with the class of class='wavingwrap' 

Link to demo is at http://andrei.rebornweb.co.nz/hi

if you want the Waving.js go to wavingcssanimations folder :)

The CSS3 compiliation on there is from Callmenick.com so Thanks to that Guy :)
