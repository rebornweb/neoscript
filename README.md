#The Bella Theme is a General SASS/HTML5 Theme to start with 

Working Demo of the simple Bella put in action for a Photography website at
http://lavolpe.rebornweb.co.nz but i changed the header and the navigation on this site.

#What's here is just the 'simple version of the Bella Theme'

Which is Responsive and Has a "Hamburger" and Dropdown menu Nav Using SASS/css,
I recommend you switch to using a SASS compiler which generates CSS if you haven't
already :)
