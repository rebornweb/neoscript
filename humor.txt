/*The Problem about being a Programmer


My mum said:
"Honey, please go to the market and buy 1 Bottle of milk. If they have eggs,
bring 6
"
I came back with 6 bottles of milk.

She said: "Why did you buy 6 bottles of milk?"

I said: "Cause they had EGGS!!"

*/
var milk = 6;
var eggs = true;

function mumAsks() {

if(eggs){
console.log("You bought " + milk + " Bottles of Milk");

}

};

mumAsks();
